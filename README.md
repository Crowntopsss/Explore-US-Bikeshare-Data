# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

## Overview
- In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. 
- I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics. 
- I also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.
